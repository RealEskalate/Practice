# starter project mobile

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application starter challenge.

# Current Exercise - Flutter challenge

This excercise is intendend to make sure everyone is on the same page in using
flutter for mobile application development.

## Steps to follow

All `git` and github workflows must be followed with a single change on commit the commit message
since we have multiple teams and Mobile team is responsible for this particular excercise make sure
to add `[Mobile]` before your git messages. (eg. `[Mobile] Update README.md`)

1. **_pull_** the update into the main branch and **_create_** a new branch or **_rebase_** if you want to use
   an existing branch.
2. Creat your own screen in `lib/screens` directory with a name `yourname_page.dart`
3. Go to your page and add a static varibale with a name `PageRoute` and set the value as `/yourname`
4. In Order to see what is going on your page you will need to creat the route first, so go to file
   `lib/route.dart` and add your page to the route. (there is an already written example to follow)
5. Now your route is ready, then go to `/lib/screes/main_drawer.dart` and add your route with your name
   you can refer the example provided by Kaleb
6. Now you are ready to build your page :) NOTE: here there is not limitation to what you can do
   get creative and try to express your self with beautyful UI
7. Lastly, you need to make you understand bloc state management, Here you can have any state you want on your page
   that is going to change with click or input or litrally anything. After have your state defined you will need to go to
   `lib/bloc/` dir and create the block Events and States then use this bloc in your page to manage your state.
